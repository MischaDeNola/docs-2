1. The number of [**tables set to replicate**]({{ link.replication.syncing | prepend: site.baseurl }}),
2. The [**Replication Methods**]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) used by the replicating tables,
3. The [**Replication Frequency**]({{ link.replication.rep-frequency | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of your integrations, which defines how **often** Stitch should attempt to replicate data from the selected tables, and
4. The **volume and structure** of the data in the selected tables. Some Stitch destinations - like Redshift and PostgreSQL - will break apart nested records and count each sub-record as a row. [Click here for an in-depth explanation of how Stitch de-nests nested records]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
