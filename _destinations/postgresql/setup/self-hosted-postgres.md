#        Requirements        #
# -------------------------- #

requirements:
  - item: |
      **An up-and-running Postgres instance.** Instructions for installing {{ destination.display_name }} and creating an initial database are outside the scope of this tutorial; our instructions assume that you have a {{ destination.display_name }} instance up and running. For help installing and getting started with {{ destination.display_name }}, refer to the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).
  - item: |
      **A {{ destination.display_name }} instance running on {{ site.data.destinations.reference[destination.type]stitch-details-info.supported-versions }} or above.** While this isn't something that Stitch strictly enforces, we recommend keeping your [version current as a best practice](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).
  - item: |
      **`createdb` permissions in your {{ destination.display_name }} instance.** This is required to create a database for Stitch.


# -------------------------- #
#         Instructions       #
# -------------------------- #

steps:
  - title: "Whitelist Stitch's IP addresses"
    anchor: "whitelist-stitch-ips"
    content: |
      {% include shared/whitelist-stitch-ips.html %}

  - title: "Create a Postgres database"
    anchor: "create-postgres-database"
    content: |
      Next, youâ€™ll create a database in your {{ destination.display_name }} instance for Stitch. This is where data replicated by Stitch will be stored.

      {% include destinations/postgres/create-database.html %}

  - title: "Retrieve your Public Key"
    anchor: "retrieve-public-key"
    content: |
      {% include shared/retrieve-public-key.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch Linux user"
    anchor: "create-stitch-linux-user"
    content: |
      {% include shared/create-linux-user.html %}

  - title: "Create a {{ destination.display_name }} Stitch user"
    anchor: "create-stitch-user"
    content: |
      {% assign clean-database-name = page.display_name | downcase %}

      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: You must have superuser privileges or the ability to create a user and grant privileges to complete this step." %}

      In the following tabs are the instructions for creating a Stitch {{ destination.display_name }} database user and explanations for the permissions Stitch requires.

      {% include destinations/templates/destination-user-setup.html database-type=clean-database-name %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      To complete the setup, you need to enter your {{ destination.display_name }} connection details into the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page in Stitch.

      {% include destinations/setup/destination-settings.html %}
